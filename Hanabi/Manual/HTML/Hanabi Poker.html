                <h2>On the Subject of Hanabi Poker</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Why rip off one game at a time, when you could rip off *two*?</p>

                <p>
                    Before the module begins, there are three buttons.
					The top button starts the module, and the othe two can turn on and off certain Modifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your goal in this module is to earn 150 chips within one deck of cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deck, without any modifiers, contains five suits - Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.
					Each suit normally has 10 cards - 3 ones, 1 five, and 2 twos, threes, and fours.
					When a modifier is taken, it adds (or removes, for Anti- modifiers) a suit to the deck.
					Once you click Start Round, the deck is shuffled together, and you are dealt a hand of five cards.
                </p>
				<p>
					To play your hand, tap on the top area of the module. It will be played, score chips, and then will be discarded.
				</p>
                <p>
                    You can discard cards by 'cluing' their number or suit. A clue discards all applicable cards in your hand, so be careful.
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>A <b>suit</b> clue can be made by tapping the bottom-left until the desired suit is shown.</li>
					<li>A <b>rank</b> clue can be made by tapping the bottom-right until the desired rank is shown.</li>
					<li>To submit a clue, simply tap the other corner.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Once you start a clue, you cannot stop it unless you play your current hand hand.
                </p>
				<p>
					You start with 4 clues, and gain 1 every time you play a hand. It may not always be worth using them all at once, so judge carefully.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next page has a list of all the different hand types. The pages after have a list of all of the modifiers.
				</p>
				<p>	If there are more than 5 suits in your deck, the base chip value for a hand is multiplied by (5 / # of suits).<br>
				Hands are score with additive effects before multiplicative. Every multiplicative effect is rounded down.
				</p>
